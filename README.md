## What is FastOrm4j

FastOrm4j is a standalone library that favors the integration of software systems adhering to the object-oriented programming paradigm with RDBMS systems. This library was created for Java 17, the latest LTS.

Unlike the others, this one generates the classes in runtime, guaranteeing maximum performance.
In addition, error management is managed through the FResult, with a paradigm inspired by Rust.
